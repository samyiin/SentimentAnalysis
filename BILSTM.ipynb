Better shown in a graph. I always get confused by the \"layer of LSTM\" to \"LSTM cell for each word\". each layer will handle an entire sentence, and out put just one h_n for each sentence. For each sentence there are many words so it might be passed to the same layer of LSTM recurrently, each time a word passed to the LSTM cell it will create a h_n, but this h_n will be passed again into the same layer in the next word's step. \n",
    "Also, bi-directional is not two layer of LSTM stacking up. (It might be a little confusing from the graph), it is the same layer, just first time we pass the sentence (list of word) in the front order and second time the reverse order. So each layer will create two h_n and c_n pair. \n",
